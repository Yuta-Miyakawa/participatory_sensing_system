# participatory_sensing_system
This study is designed to evaluate the performance and sustainability of different participatory sensing systems under consistent initial conditions. In this source code, we compare three types of participatory sensing systems with initial user count set to 200, total rounds set to 100, and the number of trials set to 100. For each system, we obtain and graph the remaining number of users and the total data quality at each round. Additionally, we calculate the average data quality per round from the total data quality for each round and output it to the command line.
